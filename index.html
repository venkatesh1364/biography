<h2>&#10003;To me, it wasn’t the winning moment, it was 15-20 minutes ago’: MS Dhoni on his match winning six in the 2011 ICC World Cup final</h2>
<p>&#10003;It has been more than 12 years since India won the 2011 ICC World Cup at home with the then Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni sealing the final win against Sri Lanka with a towering six. It was India’s first World Cup win in 28 years after the 1983 triumph and Dhoni has now revealed an emotionally high moment from the tense final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.
</p>
<p>&#10003;The best feeling was 15-20 minutes (before the winning moment). We didn’t need a lot of runs, the partnership was well-placed, there was a lot of dew. And the stadium started to sing Vande Mataram. That atmosphere I feel is very difficult to recreate – maybe in this [upcoming 2023] World Cup, there is a similar scenario, once the stadium, the fans start contributing. You know, it’s a very difficult (atmosphere) one to replicate. But it can only be replicated if the occasion is similar to that (in 2011) and there are like 40, 50 or 60,000 people who are singing,” Dhoni said in a conversation with former Australian batsman Mike Hussey in an ICC event commemorating India’s 2011 World Cup win ‘s 12th anniversary in Mumbai on Sunday.
